# Vehicle-Comparator-App
The Car Comparator App is a standalone Angular application that allows users to compare up to three vehicles side by side within the same category. The app integrates with the DriveSmart Multi-Car Comparator API to fetch normalized vehicle specification data and present it in a clear, easy-to-read comparison table.

Built using Angular standalone components, the application focuses on performance, simplicity, and extensibility. It is ideal for automotive reviews, editorial content, research, or consumer decision-making tools, and can easily be extended with charts, filters, or additional data sources.

Key Features

- Compare up to three vehicles simultaneously
- Real-time data via the DriveSmart comparator API
- Clean, side-by-side specification comparison
- Modern Angular standalone architecture (no NgModules)
- Easily extensible for charts, categories, and SEO enhancements

This project serves as a solid foundation for building automotive comparison tools, review platforms, or embedded widgets for automotive-focused websites. The project will be a base project and expanded upon as and when needed, with the sole aim to streamline the vehicles down to vehicles only available for specific markets
